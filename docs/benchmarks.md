# Benchmarks

Benchmarks here are receipts, not universal claims. Always include the setup details needed to reproduce them.

Fresh seed results are stored as schema-validated JSON under data/results/ and rendered through the hosted explorer at https://5p00kyy.github.io/club-5060ti/. Imported llm-bench rows are archived historical data and should be redone before comparison use.

The explorer defaults to one card per model/setup, with prompt-specific benchmark rows inside each card. Repeated runs are collapsed to the highest-generation row for each prompt while keeping averages and the run count visible. MTP/speculation, hardware lane, thinking mode, and reasoning budget are shown on each card.

Long-retrieval rows use a synthetic filler prompt and short-answer retrieval target. Treat them as long-prompt fit/retrieval checks, not sustained decode benchmarks.

## Single-GPU Presets

Current single-card examples:

- examples/llamacpp-single-5060ti.ini - Qwen3.5 9B high-context MTP and no-MTP presets.
- examples/llamacpp-single-5060ti-qwen36-27b-iq4xs.ini - Qwen3.6 27B IQ4_XS no-MTP presets at 32768 q8 KV and 65536 q4 KV.
- examples/llamacpp-single-5060ti-qwen36-35b-a3b-iq3xxs.ini - Qwen3.6 35B A3B IQ3_XXS thinking presets at 204800 and native max context.

Qwen3.6 27B MTP Q4_XL is not currently a valid one-card GPU-only preset on this seed system because the model allocation fails on a single 16GB card. The current useful one-card MTP/no-MTP comparison is Qwen3.5 9B.

## Current Comparison Gaps

- Qwen3.6 27B no-MTP on 2x5060ti with the same quant/context as the MTP route, if a clean non-MTP route is available.
- Qwen3.6 35B A3B NVFP4/MTP belongs in a separate vLLM engine lane, not mixed into the llama.cpp GGUF rows.
- Reasoning-budget sweeps for Qwen3.6 35B A3B should be added as quality/latency rows once the baseline speed data is stable.
- Community multi-card submissions should start with the same prompt sets and schema fields so 3x/4x results can sit beside the 1x and 2x lanes.

## Benchmark Hygiene

When adding results, say whether tokens/sec is decode-only or end-to-end, include generated token count, prompt/context size, runtime version, quant, KV cache dtype, MTP/speculative settings, thinking mode, and reasoning budget.
