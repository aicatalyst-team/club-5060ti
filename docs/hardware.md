# Tested Hardware

Initial results come from one dual-GPU Linux system.

| Component | Value |
| --- | --- |
| GPU | 2x NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Ti |
| VRAM | 16GB per card, 32GB total |
| Driver | 595.58.03 |
| GPU architecture | Blackwell-class, compute 12.0 |
| System/chassis | Dell Precision Tower 7810 |
| Motherboard | Dell 0GWHMW |
| Host CPU | 2x Intel Xeon E5-2680 v4 |
| Host RAM | 128GB DDR4-2133 |
| Inference environment | Proxmox LXC |
| Inference CPU allocation | 16 vCPU |
| Inference RAM allocation | 60GB |
| PCIe link width | x8 on both RTX 5060 Ti cards |
| Runtime style | Linux LXC, CUDA containers for vLLM |

## PCIe Topology Matters

For multi-GPU inference, the slot wiring and negotiated link state can change how much tensor-parallel traffic hurts. A result from two cards at x16/x16 is not directly comparable to x16/x4 or x4/x4 without that context.

The seed setup has both RTX 5060 Ti cards running at x8 link width. Capture the full topology and link generation when possible:

~~~bash
nvidia-smi --query-gpu=index,name,pci.bus_id,pcie.link.gen.current,pcie.link.gen.max,pcie.link.width.current,pcie.link.width.max --format=csv
lspci -tv
sudo dmidecode -t system -t baseboard
~~~

The current seed benchmark rows are still useful as working recipe receipts. Treat PCIe-sensitive comparisons as host-specific unless the report includes slot wiring plus negotiated link width and generation.

## What Seems To Matter

- 16GB per card is tight for 27B-class models, so quantization and KV cache choices matter.
- Tensor parallel across both cards is the useful default for vLLM 27B NVFP4 serving.
- fp8 KV cache is important for long context experiments.
- Blackwell support is still moving quickly. Runtime version, container image, and CUDA architecture target matter more than they would on older, mature cards.
- Motherboard layout and PCIe link width/gen matter for community reports. Include them if you know them.
- Power limits and thermals matter for sustained decode. Include them when sharing numbers.

## Blackwell And Mixed-GPU Scope

The project name reflects the tested baseline, not a claim that every recipe is Blackwell-only. llama.cpp/GGUF results may transfer to other NVIDIA cards, especially when VRAM is similar, but mixed-architecture results should be reported separately from the 2x RTX 5060 Ti lane.

For non-5060 Ti or mixed-architecture builds, set the CUDA architectures explicitly when building llama.cpp, for example:

~~~bash
CUDA_ARCHITECTURES="86;89;120a" scripts/update-llama.sh
~~~

Use the architecture list supported by your installed CUDA/CMake toolchain. See docs/gpu-compatibility.md for the full caveats.

## What Not To Generalize Yet

- Single RTX 5060 Ti results may look very different.
- Mixed GPU results should be reported separately from dual-5060 Ti results.
- Motherboard PCIe layout may matter for multi-GPU setups.
- Different CPUs, RAM allocation, and host memory bandwidth may change long-context behavior.
- New vLLM, CUDA, and modelopt builds may change the best flags.
