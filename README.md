# club-5060ti

Practical local LLM recipes, benchmark receipts, and setup notes for RTX 5060 Ti 16GB systems.

The project focus is simple: make RTX 5060 Ti local inference more reproducible across one card, two cards, and larger community setups. Some llama.cpp/GGUF notes are useful on other NVIDIA cards too, but non-5060 Ti and mixed-GPU results should be reported as separate hardware lanes. Every useful result should come with the launch shape, hardware context, model details, benchmark method, and caveats needed for someone else to reproduce or improve it.

## Start Here

| Path | Use this when | Entry point |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hardware lanes | You want to understand how 1x, 2x, 4x/multi, and other CUDA GPU results are separated. | docs/hardware-lanes.md |
| 1x RTX 5060 Ti | You want the best single-card fits and conservative starter configs. | docs/single-5060ti.md |
| 2x RTX 5060 Ti | You want dual-16GB recipes for 27B-class and long-context models. | docs/llamacpp-qwen36.md |
| Other CUDA GPUs | You want to adapt the recipes to non-5060 Ti or mixed-architecture NVIDIA setups. | docs/gpu-compatibility.md |
| Results explorer | You want to compare benchmark receipts and imported legacy data. | https://5p00kyy.github.io/club-5060ti/ |
| Benchmark protocol | You want to submit or compare a result without mixing methods. | docs/benchmark-protocol.md |

## Current Direction

club-5060ti collects tested RTX 5060 Ti recipes and benchmark receipts. It is a 5060 Ti project first, not specifically a dual-5060 Ti project: single-card, dual-card, and larger 5060 Ti setups are all useful when labeled clearly. It is not meant to claim that only Blackwell cards can use these workflows; it keeps the 5060 Ti lanes clear so community results from other cards remain comparable instead of blended together. The results explorer is built from checked-in JSON under data/results/ so docs, scripts, and the static site all describe the same evidence.

Imported llm-bench rows are archived historical data until they are rerun under the benchmark protocol. They are useful provenance, not headline evidence.

## Tested Baseline

Seed hardware:

- GPUs: 2x NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB
- Driver: 595.58.03
- Total VRAM: 32GB across two cards
- System: Dell Precision Tower 7810, Dell 0GWHMW board
- CPU: 2x Intel Xeon E5-2680 v4
- Host memory: 128GB DDR4-2133
- Inference environment: Proxmox LXC with 16 vCPU and 60GB RAM assigned
- PCIe link width: both RTX 5060 Ti cards run at x8 in this host

See docs/hardware.md for the full baseline and hardware notes.

## Recipe Index

| Lane | Model | Evidence | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| upstream llama.cpp | Qwen3.6 27B MTP GGUF | Seed recipe | Current recipe uses Q4_K_XL, q8 KV, tensor split, and draft-MTP. |
| upstream llama.cpp | Qwen3.5 9B MTP GGUF | Seed recipe | Small long-context route; useful sanity lane for 1x and 2x cards. |
| upstream llama.cpp | Qwen3.6 35B A3B GGUF | Seed recipe | Strong MoE/active-parameter comparison route. |
| ik_llama.cpp | Qwen3.6 27B IQ4/IQ5 | Comparison target | Needs controlled CUDA testing before any headline comparison. |
| BeeLlama | Qwen3.6 27B DFlash/TurboQuant | Comparison target | Only compare with equal target/KV/context settings once the route is testable. |
| vLLM | Qwen3.6 27B NVFP4/MTP | Comparison target | Historical notes exist, but this needs current benchmark JSON before promotion. |
| vLLM | BNB4/AutoRound routes | Experimental notes | Do not promote CPU-offload health checks as useful recipes. |

## Results And Data

Canonical result files live under data/results/ and follow data/schema/benchmark-result.schema.json.

Build the static site data:

~~~bash
python3 scripts/build_site_data.py
~~~

Validate result JSON:

~~~bash
python3 scripts/validate_results.py data/results
~~~

Run a protocol-shaped OpenAI-compatible benchmark:

~~~bash
python3 scripts/run_openai_bench.py \
  --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1 \
  --model Qwen3.6-27B \
  --prompt-set short-chat \
  --prompt-set code-generate \
  --prompt-set agent-tool \
  --runs 1 \
  --no-thinking \
  --output data/results/my-run.json
~~~

The old llm-bench summary rows have been imported into data/results/llm-bench-legacy-import.json as archived historical data. Rerun them under the benchmark protocol before using them for comparisons.

The hosted explorer defaults to one card per model/setup, with prompt-specific benchmark rows inside each card. Generation tok/s is output-token speed; prompt eval tok/s is prompt/prefill processing speed. MTP/speculation and thinking mode are shown on each card and can be filtered directly. Enable "raw runs" in the explorer to inspect repeated measurements.

Results are expected to grow over time. New community reports can be added as archived notes, recipe evidence, benchmark rows, or verified reproductions depending on how complete and comparable they are.

## Submit A Result

The preferred path is a GitHub issue using the result report template. Include the hardware lane, exact GPU count, PCIe topology, runtime, model, quant, context, KV cache, generated-token count, prompt eval tok/s, generation tok/s, and caveats.

If you want a structured result file, generate JSON with scripts/run_openai_bench.py, validate it with scripts/validate_results.py, and attach or submit the JSON. See docs/reporting-results.md.

## Model Downloads

The download helper wraps the Hugging Face CLI and accepts a Hugging Face author or organization, model repo name, optional quant/file selector, and optional download directory:

~~~bash
scripts/download-models.sh unsloth Qwen3.6-27B-MTP-GGUF Q4_K_XL ~/models/Qwen3.6-27B-MTP-GGUF
scripts/download-models.sh unsloth Qwen3.6-27B-MTP-GGUF Qwen3.6-27B-UD-Q6_K_XL.gguf ~/models/Qwen3.6-27B-MTP-GGUF
scripts/download-models.sh RedHatAI Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-NVFP4 '' ~/models/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-NVFP4
~~~

When the selector ends in `.gguf`, it is treated as an exact file. Otherwise it becomes a GGUF include pattern, so `Q4_K_XL` downloads matching `*Q4_K_XL*.gguf` files. Leave the selector empty to download the full repository.

Install either the `hf` CLI or `huggingface-cli` before running it, and log in first when downloading gated models. Set `MODEL_DIR` if you want a different default root.

## llama.cpp Build Helper

~~~bash
scripts/update-llama.sh
~~~

This builds the upstream llama.cpp tree used by the Qwen3.6 GGUF examples. The helper is a reproducible public build path, not a service manager for a specific deployment.

The default CUDA architecture target is `120a` for RTX 5060 Ti / Blackwell. For other CUDA GPUs or mixed-architecture builds, pass the architectures explicitly:

~~~bash
CUDA_ARCHITECTURES="86;89;120a" scripts/update-llama.sh
~~~

Use the architecture list supported by your installed CUDA/CMake toolchain and record the exact value in your result. See docs/gpu-compatibility.md before treating mixed-card results as comparable with the 2x RTX 5060 Ti baseline.

## Contribution Standard

Contributions are most useful when they include exact GPU model, motherboard/PCIe layout, negotiated link width/generation, driver/runtime versions, launch commands, context length, KV cache settings, prompt shape, generated token count, tokens/sec, and relevant caveats.

Start with CONTRIBUTING.md and docs/benchmark-protocol.md.

## Verification

~~~bash
python3 -m py_compile scripts/*.py
bash -n scripts/*.sh examples/*.sh
python3 scripts/validate_results.py data/results
python3 scripts/build_site_data.py
./scripts/check_repo.sh
~~~
